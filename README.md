## 🎯 Project Purpose

The goal of this repository is to simulate a real workplace development environment where team members:

- Collaborate using GitHub
- Work on separate branches
- Commit and track changes
- Merge work into the main branch safely

This helps us learn how professional software teams manage projects.

## 🔁 Team Workflow

We follow these basic steps for collaboration:

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a new branch for personal work
3. Make changes and commit them
4. Push changes to GitHub
5. Create a Pull Request to merge into `main`

This avoids conflicts and keeps the project organized.
